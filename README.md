# Replication of "Hidden Income and the Perceived Returns to Migration"

## Overview
This project is a replication and robustness check of *Hidden Income and the Perceived Returns to Migration* by Baseler (2023, AEJ: Applied Economics). The study investigates how information frictions affect migration decisions in Kenya. This replication aims to verify the reproducibility of Baseler's findings and assess the impact of alternative data processing choices.

## Key Components
- **Computational Reproducibility:** Reproduction of all analytical findings using the provided replication package.
- **Robustness Tests:** Examination of the sensitivity of results to Winsorization of outcome variables and alternative modeling choices (e.g., Tobit model).
- **Data Sources:** Includes rural household surveys from 2016â€“2019 and secondary datasets from the Kenya Integrated Household Budget Survey (KIHBS), IPUMS census data, and Young (2013) migration data.

## Replication Findings
- All primary analytical results from Baseler (2023) were computationally reproduced.
- The impact of information on migration decisions was confirmed, particularly in Nairobi.
- Winsorization had some influence on statistical significance but did not overturn core conclusions.
- A Tobit model yielded slightly different coefficient estimates, particularly for outcomes with a high proportion of zeros.
